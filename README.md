# DWR Enhanced Post Processing Tool (EPPT)

The DWR Enhanced Post Processor Tool (EPPT) is a Windows desktop user interface application that will allow experienced CalSim/ CalLite users to review, compare and report study results. The major features of the application include:
1.	Quick Results, model run comparison using pre-defined metrics and selection options for time, parameter, and location. 
2.	DTS Report, similar to Quick Results but introduces derived time series (DTS) that allows for comparison between model variables.
3.	Schematic View (*will be developed in a subsequent version), comparison and drill-down of model runs presented using a schematic view of the system.
4.	QA/QC Report, model run comparison presented as a PDF report that includes summary information and detailed graphs and tables.
