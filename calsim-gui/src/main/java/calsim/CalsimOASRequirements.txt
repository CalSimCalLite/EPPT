Calsim Output Analysis System -- Wish List

* Add Requirements/Wishes to this list, but do not remove any

*********************************************************************************
Phase 1 (Immediate Need):
*********************************************************************************
At the end of this phase the Gui should be able to perform all the functionality 
of DSIMMENU.  Data access will be possible based upon nodes, arcs, and groups.  
In addition, specialty reports will be generated by the Gui.  The Menu System will 
be released to the studies group for testing at the end of this phase.

General
-------
1. Ability to query information based on nodes and arcs
        - flow / storage information for each node
        - table/graph display for requested information
2. Ability to query information based on groups of nodes/arcs
        - display results in a standard monthly table format
        - display results in a bar graph
        - save/load groups from text based descriptions
        - view/edit groups in a table
        - assign names to each group 
        - +,- operations between groups 
        - printing capability
	- ability to do change-in-storage calculations
	- ability to do difference between two studies, % difference,
ratio between two studies.
3. Replacement for D-SIM-Menu
        - collect requirements from Tirath Sandhu, Sushil, Hamid
        - baseline to do as much as it and possibly more.

4. Operate in two modes
        - comparitive mode 
        - absolute mode 

Specific Requirements
---------------------
1. Gui design in Java JDK 1.1.7, using Swing components wherever possible. Use
swing 1.1 for forward compatibility with Java 1.2.
2. Main menu bar should contain File, Edit, View, Mode, Node, Arc, Group, General, 
    Project, Basin, and Report menus.
3. File menu will contain the following functionality:
    * Open DSS files (Dvar and Svar) for the current study.  Static Vista Groups are
        created.
    * Open DSS files (Dvar and Svar) for the comparison study - (optional).  Static 
        Vista Groups are created.
    * The current selected files should be displayed prominently in the GUI
    * Close/Exit main program.
4. Edit menu will allow the user to change the working time window.  Other global 
    features may be added to this menu.
5. View menu will contain the user output preference.  All view items should access 
    the user specified time window for display. This menu will not produce any output, 
    but specifies the output type when other menu items are activated.  The following 
    outputs must be available:
    * Table - Vista Data Table standard output.  Must also account for grouped data 
        to be shown as MultiData Tables.
    * Graph - Vista plots of single and multiple data sets.  
    * Monthly Table - Monthly summary of data for entire time window (DSIMMENU 
        screen.out). Minimum, maximum, average, and total should be computed and 
        displayed.  The summary table should be displayed on screen and exportable 
        to a text file.
6. Mode menu will contain the user preference of single study outputs or comparison 
    outputs.  Normal refers to the current study and Compare refers to the difference 
    between the current study and the comparison study. The user may only specify one 
    mode at a time. 
7. Node menu will access single data sets specific to nodes.  The current data sets 
    (and DSS Bparts) are Storage EOP (S#), Inflow (I#), Evaporation (E#), Surface 
    Area (A#), and Non-Recoverable Spill (F#).  In addition, mass balance should be 
    computed for each node by reading arcs from the connectivity-table.csv file.  
    Vista groups should be filtered by specified Bparts and Cparts.
8. Arc menu performs a similar function to the Node menu. The current data sets (and 
    DSS Bparts) are Channel Flow (C#), Delivery (D#), and Return Flow (R#).  More 
    data sets will be added in the future (Required minimum flow, Channel capacity,
    Delivery AG, Demand AG, etc).  No mass balance is performed for arcs.
9. Groups will serve as the backbone for most of the data access. These groups may 
    be read from text files and/or created/edited/saved from within the Gui.  Groups
    will be able to perform simple addition and subtraction of data sets OR 
    non-mathematical display of outputs.  A group will consist of one or more data 
    sets and an optional operator.  The specification of data sets will include the 
    File Type (Dvar or Svar), Bpart, and Cpart.  The operator will instruct the Gui
    to add/subtract the current data set from the previous data set(s).  The Group 
    menu should also contain the following functionality:
    * Open Group from text file (extension .gp)
    * Save/Save as group to text file.
    * Retrieve group data from DSS file and display data accordingly. 
10. General menu will allow data access to user-specified pathnames (or parts). 
    More generalized data access may be added to this menu.
11. Project menu will contain several submenus for the SWP and CVP.  In turn each 
    of these menus will contain submenus relating to specific data requirements 
    (Ag deliveries, total storage, etc).  These submenus will point to specific 
    pre-defined groups containing the data sets and math operators.  The name and 
    type of these submenus are likely to change frequently, but several will be:
    * State Water Project
        - General Operation ==> DSIMMENU General Operation menu items
        - Contractor Delivery ==> DSIMMENU Contractor Delivery menu items
        - Delivery Summary ==> DSIMMENU Delivery Summary menu items
    * Central Valley Project
        - General Operation ==> DSIMMENU General Operation menu items
        - Contractor Delivery ==> DSIMMENU Contractor Delivery menu items
        - Delivery Summary ==> DSIMMENU Delivery Summary menu items
12. Basin menu, similar to Project menu, will point to specific groups for each 
    particular basin.  Some common items for all basins are storage, inflow, 
    outflow, total deliveries, imports, delivery shortage, and mass balance.  
    Other specific items will be included for each basin (i.e. Delta operations, 
    Stanislaus operations, etc.).
13. Reports menu will perform the display and output of specialty reports.  The 
    current menu items should include Delta (and other basins) Mass Balance, Water
    Supply Impact, SWP and CVP deliveries, and Channel Depletion outputs. Each one
    of these will require an associated group and separate programming for display
    of data.
    
Milestones
----------
Testing to be associated with each milestone and/or weekly.

1.  Complete group functionality (Req. 9).
2.  Restructure GUI for JPanel and clean up existing code.
3.  Complete Monthly Table summary output (Req. 5)
4.  Add functionality of Project and Basin menus ( Req. 11,12)
5.  Create group text files for all menu items where necessary.
6.  Create specific reports (Req. 13).



**********************************************************************************
Phase 2:
**********************************************************************************
Phase 2 will build upon the developments of phase 1 and add standardization to the 
numerous output types. Reports and monthly tables will be standardized with common 
text fields and titles, and quality will be improved for direct importation into 
public documents.  Improved graphing capabilities should either be implemented in 
this phase or the data could be exported to Excel for report quality plots.

General
-------
1. Ability to organized collection of groups in a project. 
    - generate/print report quality tables from these groups
    - ability to add/remove groups from projects
    - ability to save/load projects from text based files
    - assign names to projects



*********************************************************************************
Phase 3:
*********************************************************************************
Phase 3 will introduce the interactive schematic for data access.  Nodes and arcs 
will be objects containing several data types:  timeseries and static. 

General
-------
1. Ability to view schematic and query it
    - calsim schematic based
    - ability to edit/create schematic 
    - ability to create/generate connectivity table
    - modes to query for
        - weights
        - data associated with symbols
        - tool tip showing name of each symbol 

2. Operate in sensitivity analysis mode
