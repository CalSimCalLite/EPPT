    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By default the data would be displayed for the full time window available in the dss file. To
    change this select <B>Edit|Time Window</B>. This should open up a dialog with input for the time window string. The
    time window must be entered in MMMyyyy - MMMyyyy format, where the d is the day of the month, M is the character for
    month, y is the year, H is the 2400 format time and m is the time of the hour in minutes. <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, to select OCT 1935 - SEP&nbsp;1965 enter OCT1935 - SEP1965. This will be improved in
    the coming versions but bear with us for now. Also notice the space between the year and hour and the single dash
    between the start and end times. <BR>
