    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiple time series are just groups of data that one intends to view together. These are very
    similar to DTS except that they don't have operations defined between them. Only the table and graph views are
    available on them for now. <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MTS can be manipulated in a similar way as DTS. <BR>
