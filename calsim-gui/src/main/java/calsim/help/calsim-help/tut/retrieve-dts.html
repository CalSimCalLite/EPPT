    DTS:</U></FONT> <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the DTS/MTS toggle button first, then click on the <B>DTS|New</B> menu item. This should
    open a table in a new frame. The table is used to define operations between existing data sets in the model run.
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a text field at the top of the table with some name. Edit the name to suit your desire.
    You will be warned about conflicts with existing names. Let us enter Exports in that field. <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first column is the operator column. A user can select one of +,-,/,* operations. The
    operation is always between the result of the previous rows and the row on which the operation is present. The first
    row's operation column is ignored. <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select <B>Edit|Add</B> <B>Row</B>. This should add a row to the table. Select + from the first
    column, DVAR from the third column, B Part column set to D59 and C part set to FLOW <BR>
    So the first row looks like: <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; +,&nbsp;&nbsp; , DVAR, D59, FLOW <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select <B>Edit|Add</B> <B>Row </B>again, set the second row to look like <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +,&nbsp; , DVAR, D86, FLOW </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To save this DTS select <B>Table|Save</B> item and save to a file with .dts extension. <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To retrieve data for this operation select <B>Table|Retrieve</B>. This should display the types
    that have been previously selected <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A user can select a data set from the other columns in the table. The DerivedTimeSeries column is
    used to select from one of previously defined DTS's. If this is not selected then the user can choose using a bpart
    and cpart and the type of variable ( decision or state ) from the last 3 columns. <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To save time we have defined exports.dts and inflows.dts. This time to get these definitions into
    the current project select <B>DTS|Open</B>. Then choose the appropriate DTS (dts) file. This should display in a
    table from which one can then retrieve the data or edit them further. <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also open eiratio.dts DTS file using the above procedure. This should demonstrate how previous
    definitions be used in the operations that are defined between the time series. <BR>
    &nbsp; </P>
<P>Note: You should always set the project to ready first. Please see "<A HREF="prepare-proj.html">Prepare a project for
    study</A>".</P></BODY>
