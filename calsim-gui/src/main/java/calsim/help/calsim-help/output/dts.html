    <P>A Derived Time Series (DTS) consists of a mathematical combination of other time series [single time series
        and/or DTS]. To create a DTS, select the Output tab, then the DTS Tree tab. Select a location (folder) in the
        DTS Tree (left window on the DTS Tree tab), right click on the selected folder and select "Add DTS" from the
        pop-up menu. Rename the added DTS by right-clicking on it, select "rename" from the pop-up menu, then type the
        desired name. Alternatively, to rename it, slowly click two or three times on its name to insert the typing
        cursor and type the desired name. Select the time series to define the DTS by using the DTS Table (right window
        on the DTS Tree tab), the subject of two pages hence.</P>
