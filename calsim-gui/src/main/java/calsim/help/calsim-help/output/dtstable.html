<P>To edit a derived time series (DTS) or multiple time series (MTS), first select the Output tab, then the DTS Tree
    tab. In the DTS tree, find the DTS or MTS file, opening folders as needed. Select the file. Its name and current
    time series components will be loaded into the DTS Table (right window on the DTS Tree tab). If editing a DTS, the
    "Operator" column will be present; if editing a MTS, the "Operator" column will not be present.</P>

<P>Use the buttons on the bottom of DTS Table window to add, insert, and delete rows in the table. The add button adds a
    row to the bottom of the table; the Insert button adds a row before the topmost currently selected row and the
    Delete button deletes the currently selected row(s). The Open button opens the currently selected dts (in the tree
    window) if the selected row does not contain a derived time series, or it <B><I><U>(gives an Exception
        currently)</B></I></U> if the DTS in the selected row if the row contains a derived time series. If editing a
    DTS, select the appropriate mathematical operator (+, -, *, or /) for each row. If a row is to contain a DTS, select
    one in the Derived Time Series column; this will clear the row's B-part and C-part boxes. If a row is to contain a
    single time series, type the B-Part for the time series, and its corresponding C-part will load automatically into
    the row's C-part box. When done creating and/or editing a DTS or MTS, save it by right-clicking in the DTS Tree
    window, or by right-clicking on the file in the DTS Tree. Click <b>File</b> | <b>DTS Tree</b> | <b>Save</b> (or <b>Save
        As</b>), before closing the GUI, to save a DTS or MTS in the DTS Tree. If the GUI is closed before the DTS Tree
    is saved, restart the GUI, load the DTS Tree (or project), select the Output and DTS Tree tabs, right-click on the
    location (folder) in which the DTS or MTS is to be placed and select "Import DTS" or "Import MTS", and make sure to
    save the DTS Tree this time.</P>
