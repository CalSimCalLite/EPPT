    study is selected, the output will be from the 'Base' run regardless of whether other studies are selected. However,
    if the 'Base' study is not selected and the 'Base' mode is, the output will be from the selected 'Comp' run which is
    closest to the 'Base' run position (i.e., the selected one closest to the top). If the difference ('Diff') mode is
    selected, exactly two runs must be selected. If the 'Comp' mode is selected, two or more runs should be
    selected.</P></BODY>
