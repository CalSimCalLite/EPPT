    <P>A Multiple Time Series (MTS) is a set of time series [single time series (STS) and/or derived time series (DTS)],
        created so the time series can be displayed together. MTS's are similar to a DTS but do not involve math
        operations. To create a MTS, select the Output tab, then the DTS Tree tab. Select a location (folder) in the DTS
        Tree (left window on the DTS Tree tab), right click on the selected folder and select "Add MTS" from the pop-up
        menu. Rename the added MTS by right-clicking on it, select "rename" from the pop-up menu, then type the desired
        name. Alternatively, to rename it, slowly click two or three times on its name to insert the typing cursor and
        type the desired name. Select the time series to define the MTS by using the DTS Table (right window on the DTS
        Tree tab), the subject of the next page.</P>
