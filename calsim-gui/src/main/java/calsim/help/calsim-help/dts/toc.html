&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A derived time-series (DTS) consists of one or more time-series (TS) which may be added, subtracted
etceteras to result in another TS which may then be displayed in one of many ways. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A DTS may also derive from math operations between a mix of DTS and time series in&nbsp; the study
output. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A derived time-series will be created or edited in a JTable. Each row of the JTable will represent a
TS with an operator in the first column. The first column of the first row must contain a math operator. Rows in which
the first column is empty will be as if the last operator in the first column of previous rows is present. Rows may be
added, inserted or removed. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A DTS will be given a unique name within the project. The user will be prompted again if the given
name already exists and the option to overwrite DTS will be there. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no checks on the bparts and cparts of the given DTS till the calculation is done. If any
references are not found then they are warned about and the calculation proceeds as if they were not there. If no
reference is found to be valid then an exception is generated. <BR>
