    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the DTS/MTS toggle button first, then click on the <B>DTS|New</B> menu item. This should
    open a table in a new frame. The table is used to define operations between existing data sets in the model run.
    <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a text field at the top of the table with some name. Edit the name to suit your desire.
    You will be warned about conflicts with existing names. <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first column is the operator column. A user can select one of +, - , /, * operations. The
    operation is always between the result of the previous rows and the row on which the operation is present. The first
    row's operation column is ignored. <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select <B>Edit|Add</B> <B>Row</B>. This should add a row to the table, then you could edit this
    row. </P></BODY>
