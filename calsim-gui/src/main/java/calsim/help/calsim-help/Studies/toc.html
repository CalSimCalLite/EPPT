    system configuration files, operating rules specified in wresl files, and model run options. Studies are performed
    to simulate the behavior of a water resources system under different scenarios. Scenarios should be evaluated
    comparatively or relative to a base study. Use of absolute values from a single study may be misleading.</P></BODY>
