<B><U><FONT SIZE=4><P>What is in a Study File</P>
</B></U></FONT><P>A study file contains: a name, author, date, description, WRESL files for describing the system
    (model) and its operating rules, lookup tables (text input data files), State Variable or SV file (.<I>dss</I> input
    data file), decision varaible or DV file (.<I>dss</I> output data file), initial conditions or Init file
    (.<I>dss</I> input data file), and the options (settings) for the study. </P>

<P>In general each model study has it’s own directory structure. The study name is normally the base directory in which
    a &quot;dss&quot; and &quot;run&quot; directory are created.
    The &quot;dss&quot; directory contains the input and output HEC-DSS timeseries files. The &quot;run&quot; directory,
    as it’s name implies, is the location where the model is run. The main WRESL file and diagnostic output is located
    here. Directories named &quot;system&quot;, &quot;lookup&quot;, and &quot;external&quot; are created under the
    &quot;run&quot; directory. The &quot;system&quot; directory contains the system description tables and their
    generated WRESL files. The &quot;lookup&quot; directory contains all relational lookup tables (*.table) required for
    the model run. The &quot;external&quot; directory contains any external functions (Fortran 90 object files or C++
    dynamic link libraries) that are called from the WRESL statements.</P>
