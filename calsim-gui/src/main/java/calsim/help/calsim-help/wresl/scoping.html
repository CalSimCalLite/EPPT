<P>CALSIM allows the decision maker to specify multiple models to be simulated in a particular order. The modeler
    decides which parts of a system should be included in which models and the order in which to simulate the models.
    The decision variable results of each higher order model (ie. simulated prior to the current model) are accessible
    in the current model by using the variable name followed by [<I>ModelName</I>].</P>

<P>WRESL also includes scope, a term used to describe whether particular statements and variables are accessible outside
    of the parent model. The bracketed kewords <B>[local]</B> and <B>[global]</B> are used for this purpose. If keywords
    <B>include</B>, <B>define</B>, or <B>goal</B> are directly followed by <B>[local]</B> then this statement will only
    apply to the model in which the statement exists. However, if this keyword is absent (or <B>[global]</B> of
    specified) the statements apply to the current model and all subsequent models.</P>
