    <B><U><FONT SIZE=4><P>Wresl Language Overview</P></B></U></FONT>
<P>The Water Resources Simulation Language (WRESL) was designed to serve as flexible language interface to the linear
    programming (LP) solver and databases. Specific operational rules may be specified in the WRESL language, which in
    turns formulates the rules into constraints and objective function terms in the form acceptable to the LP solver.
    Data, in the form of timeseries input, prior decision variable values, and relational table values, are all
    available to the user when formulating the operational rules.</P>
<P>When writing statements in the WRESL language it is important to recognize the difference between state variables and
    decision variables for the time period of interest. These variables have known constant values for the upcoming
    period and can be thought of as the information available to planner/operator prior to any system operation.
    Decision variables, on the other hand, are unknown and represent the decisions to be made for the upcoming period.
    Thinking in this fashion will greatly expedite the learning of this language.</P>
<P>WRESL statements are assembled into simple text files with the <I>wresl</I> extension. The main WRESL file must
    contain the <B>model</B> and <B>sequence</B> statements that describe the constraints to be included in a particular
    simulation and the order in which models should be solved. Each model contains several <B>include</B> statements
    which identify the location of constraints to be considered. Operational constraints can be assembled in multiple
    <I>wresl</I> files and placed in directories aptly named for better organization. Several WRESL language constructs
    are available to the user in developing constraints or rules for the water resource system and are discussed in
    detail below.</P>
<B><P>Notational Conventions</P>
    <P>Bold-faced</B> words or characters represent key words and must be typed exactly as shown. <I>Italic</I> words
denote the names of identifiers or tags of your own creation. If one of several options is required, those options are
shown separated by a vertical bar ( | ) symbol; if any item is itself optional, that item appears within
<B>[brackets]</B>. Braces ( <B>{ }</B> ) provide a visual grouping of statements. <U>The examples in the WRESL help
    files do not contain the format notation and indicate preferred styles of placement and style.</P>
</U><B><P>Source Form</P></B>
<P>The WRESL language is somewhat free-format. Braces and indenting can be placed according to preference. Line breaks
    and blank lines are allowed but not required. WRESL is case insensitive, meaning keywords may be in lowercase,
    uppercase, or any combination of lowercase and uppercase. Comments may be inserted at any point. Most statements may
    be on multiple lines without a continuation character. Semicolons are not allowed at the end of statements. The
    WRESL file is read sequentially, in that the statements read and process in the order that they appear in the file.
    Variables must be declared before they can be used in other statements.</P>
