<P>In define and goal statements, you may refer to the values of any timeseries variable up to 12 time periods prior to
    the current period. Additionally, input timeseries variables may accessed up to 12 time periods ahead of the current
    period. Thus, the resulting values from previous time periods are available for determining the state of the system
    and future input values are available for forecasting purposes. This time period offset access is performed by
    adding a suffix to the decision variable name, of the form</P>

<P>Variablename(<i>OffsetExpression</i>)</P>
</B>
<P>For example, S11(-1) might refer to the storage in reservoir 11 one time step ago. <I>OffsetExpression</I> must of
    course evaluate negative for decision variables and aliases, and must be nonzero. This same form is used for
    timeseries input variables. Omitting the suffix in parentheses causes WRESL to use the value from the current model
    time step. You can specify both previous and future values (future values are positive).</P>
