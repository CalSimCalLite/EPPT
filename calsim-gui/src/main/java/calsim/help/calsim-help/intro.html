&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <P>CALSIM is a generalized water resources simulation model for evaluating operational alternatives
    of large, complex river basins. Developed by the Department of Water Resources, CALSIM integrates a simulation
    language for flexible operational criteria specification, a linear programming solver for efficient water allocation
    decisions, and graphics capabilities for ease of use. These combined capabilities provide a comprehensive and
    powerful modeling tool for water resource systems analysis.</P>
&nbsp;<P>CALSIM was originally designed, and has been successfully implemented, to replace the Department of Water
    Resources’ former planning model of the State Water Project (DWRSIM) and the US Bureau of Reclamation's models of
    the Central Valley Project (PROSIM and SANJASM). The entire system and related operational criteria are specified as
    input to the new CALSIM model and, as such, may be modified or replaced without requiring changes to the
    application.</P>
